Description: The ArcGIS 'Places service' is a ready-to-use location
    service that can search for businesses and geographic locations around
    the world. It allows you to find, locate, and discover detailed
    information about each place. Query for places near a point, within a
    bounding box, filter based on categories, or provide search text.
    'arcgisplaces' integrates with 'sf' for out of the box compatibility
    with other spatial libraries. Learn more in the 'Places service' API reference <https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/places/>.
